#AdminPanelBundle
Lots of applications are required to display tabular list of entities that have to be pagination,
also it would be nice to have the ability to sort through all fields and flexible filtering.
Those tasks can solve AdminPanelBundle.
Of course, this is not something new - the same SonataAdminBundle provides similar functionality,
but Sonata is a monster (in a good sense of the word), with many options and dependencies,
and my goal was to make a fast and flexible navigation of large tabular arrays.
